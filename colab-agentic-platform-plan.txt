Detailed plan to build an agentic system on Colab
This plan outlines how to build an orchestrator-based agentic system on Google Colab's free tier. The system will route tasks to specialized agent nodes for SOP generation or image generation.
Step 1: Set up the Colab environment
Open Google Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/.
Enable GPU: Go to Runtime > Change runtime type and select GPU.
Install dependencies: Run the following in a code cell:
python
!pip install -q -U langchain langchain-community langgraph transformers accelerate bitsandbytes
!pip install -q -U diffusers datasets torch
!pip install -q -U faiss-gpu # For fast local vector search
Use code with caution.

Connect to Google Drive: Run the following to mount your drive for persistent data storage.
python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Use code with caution.

Authenticate Hugging Face: Access gated models like Llama 3 by using your Hugging Face API key.
python
from google.colab import userdata
import os

os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = userdata.get('HF_TOKEN')
Use code with caution.

 
Step 2: Choose models and tools (with Colab tradeoffs)
Orchestrator Model
Recommendation: Use mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. It's a 7B-parameter model that offers a good balance of capability and size, making it suitable for classification tasks on Colab's T4 GPU, especially with quantization.
Tradeoff: Performance will be noticeably slower than on paid tiers or dedicated hardware. The model's reasoning capabilities, while strong for its size, are not as robust as larger models. 
SOP Generation Model
Recommendation: Use the same mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 as the orchestrator. For the SOP task, the orchestrator routes the request to this model, which is fine-tuned for instruction following and general text generation.
Tool (Personal Info DB): A local in-memory vector database using FAISS and the Sentence-Transformers library.
Tradeoff: This vector database is in-memory and non-persistent. It will be wiped with every session restart. 
Image Generation Model
Recommendation: Use a highly optimized and lightweight model like Stable Diffusion 1.5 or a fine-tuned variant. Larger models like DeepFloyd IF often exceed the free tier's memory limits.
Tradeoff: The free tier's T4 GPU has limited VRAM (around 15GB). For this reason, you may be able to generate images, but it will be slow, and the output quality might be lower than on more powerful GPUs. 
Step 3: Implement LangGraph nodes and tools
3.1: Define tools
Create the persistence tool to be used in the SOP generation node.
python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

# This is an in-memory vector store that will not persist across sessions.
db = FAISS.from_texts([""], HuggingFaceEmbeddings())

@tool
def persist_info(info: str) -> str:
    """Persists personal information to a temporary storage."""
    global db
    db.add_texts([info])
    return "Personal information stored."

@tool
def retrieve_info(query: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves personal information from temporary storage."""
    global db
    docs = db.similarity_search(query)
    return "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
Use code with caution.

3.2: Define agent nodes
Implement the functions for the orchestrator, SOP generator, and image generator.
python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFacePipeline
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline
import torch

# Load a quantized orchestrator model
model_id = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    device_map="auto",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    trust_remote_code=True
)
orchestrator_llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer))

# Load the image generation model (using the free tier GPU is challenging, so use a simple approach)
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
image_generator = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

# Orchestrator node for task routing
def orchestrator(state: dict):
    task = state['task']
    response = orchestrator_llm.invoke(f"Categorize the following task as 'sop' or 'image': {task}")
    category = response.split()[-1].strip().lower() # Simple last-word-based classification
    state['task_type'] = category
    return state

# SOP generation node
def generate_sop(state: dict):
    job_description = state['job_description']
    personal_info = retrieve_info.invoke("all personal information")
    prompt = f"Using this personal information: {personal_info}\nAnd this job description: {job_description}\nGenerate a good Statement of Purpose."
    sop_text = orchestrator_llm.invoke(prompt)
    state['output'] = sop_text
    return state

# Image generation node
def generate_image(state: dict):
    description = state['image_description']
    image = image_generator(description).images[0]
    # In Colab, you can save the image directly
    image.save("generated_image.png")
    state['output'] = "Image generated and saved as 'generated_image.png'"
    return state
Use code with caution.

Step 4: Build the LangGraph workflow
Define the state: Define the state with all necessary fields.
python
from typing import TypedDict, Optional

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    task: str
    task_type: Optional[str]
    job_description: Optional[str]
    personal_info: Optional[str]
    image_description: Optional[str]
    output: Optional[str]
Use code with caution.

Define the graph and add nodes:
python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator)
workflow.add_node("sop_generator", generate_sop)
workflow.add_node("image_generator", generate_image)
Use code with caution.

Define the routing logic: The orchestrator node will route the request based on the task_type it predicts.
python
def route_task(state: AgentState):
    if state.get('task_type') == 'sop':
        return "sop_generator"
    elif state.get('task_type') == 'image':
        return "image_generator"
    else:
        return "orchestrator" # Default back to orchestrator for clarification or retry
Use code with caution.

Add edges and compile the graph:
python
workflow.set_entry_point("orchestrator")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("orchestrator", route_task)
workflow.add_edge("sop_generator", END)
workflow.add_edge("image_generator", END)

app = workflow.compile()
Use code with caution.

 
Step 5: Execute the agent in Colab
You can now invoke your app with different tasks.
Example 1: SOP Generation
python
# First, persist some fake personal information
persist_info.invoke("My experience is in data science. I have a degree in Computer Science.")

# Run the agent for an SOP task
initial_state = {
    "task": "Create a statement of purpose for a data scientist position.",
    "job_description": "We are seeking a skilled data scientist with experience in machine learning and data analysis."
}
result = app.invoke(initial_state)
print("--- SOP Task Result ---")
print(result['output'])
Use code with caution.

Example 2: Image Generation
python
# Run the agent for an image generation task
initial_state = {
    "task": "Generate a picture of a majestic lion.",
    "image_description": "A majestic lion, with a golden mane, staring into the sunset, digital art."
}
result = app.invoke(initial_state)
print("--- Image Task Result ---")
print(result['output'])
Use code with caution.

Potential challenges on Colab's free tier
Slow orchestration is possible. The 7B model, running quantized on a T4 GPU, may be slow for complex or lengthy reasoning. Task routing accuracy might vary.
Image generation performance may be slow and resource-intensive, with possible timeouts or crashes.
Data persistence is limited. Any personal information stored in the FAISS database will be lost when the Colab session disconnects.
Availability on the free tier is not guaranteed. There is no guarantee of a GPU, and sessions have time limits.
Routing complexity is a factor. The simple keyword-based routing in this example is not ideal. A more robust solution might require a fine-tuned model for routing, which could further impact performance. 


does all this code have to be on the same notebook?
No, all the code for your LangGraph workflow does not have to be in the same notebook. In fact, it's best practice to organize your project into separate Python files (.py modules) for better readability, reusability, and maintainability. You can then import and use these modules within your Google Colab notebook. 
How to organize your code in Google Colab
The easiest and most reliable way to manage multiple Python files in Colab is by using Google Drive.
Step 1: Mount Google Drive
You already did this in the previous plan. This makes your Google Drive file system accessible from your Colab notebook. 
python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Use code with caution.

Step 2: Structure your project files
Create a dedicated folder in your Google Drive to hold your project's Python files. For example, let's create a folder called langgraph_project. 
Your folder structure might look something like this:
/content/drive/MyDrive/langgraph_project
├── __init__.py         # Important for treating the directory as a Python package
├── config.py           # Stores model names, paths, etc.
├── tools.py            # Contains your tool functions (e.g., persist_info, retrieve_info)
├── nodes.py            # Contains your agent node functions (e.g., orchestrator, generate_sop)
└── main_graph.py       # Defines and compiles the LangGraph workflow
Step 3: Add your project directory to the Python path
To be able to import modules from your langgraph_project folder, you need to add its path to your Colab notebook's system path. You only need to do this once. 
python
import sys
# Add the project directory to the Python path
sys.path.append('/content/drive/MyDrive/langgraph_project')
Use code with caution.

Step 4: Import and use your modules
Now you can import specific functions, tools, and the compiled graph from your separate Python files, just as you would in a normal Python environment. 
Example Colab notebook:
python
# --- Setup Cell ---
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

import sys
sys.path.append('/content/drive/MyDrive/langgraph_project')

# --- Main Logic Cell ---
from main_graph import app
from tools import persist_info

# First, persist some fake personal information using the imported tool
persist_info.invoke("My experience is in data science. I have a degree in Computer Science.")

# Run the agent for an SOP task using the imported app
initial_state = {
    "task": "Create a statement of purpose for a data scientist position.",
    "job_description": "We are seeking a skilled data scientist with experience in machine learning and data analysis."
}
result = app.invoke(initial_state)
print("--- SOP Task Result ---")
print(result['output'])
Use code with caution.

By following this approach, your Colab notebook remains clean, focused on the high-level orchestration, 
and easier to manage. The underlying implementation for your tools, nodes, and graph logic can be developed 
and maintained in separate, organized .py files.
